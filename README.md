ABSTRACT:
 A university is a high-level educational institution in which students study for degrees and academic research is done. Here, we’ll create a database for the university as we have data for various entities such as Student, faculty, course and many more. Each student has a particular name and same goes with the faculty members. A student is a part of only one department while the department may have many number of students or have no one because it’s optional. There are various departments. Each department has its own Faculty members teaching various Subjects. Students enroll in various subjects taught by the respective faculty. Students are graded based on their performance in their respective Examinations. We have created Student Log relation to keep track of updates to the student database. We have the relation Accounts between the student and the university. The students pay fee as per their course and scholarship.
